1:00 Reading Break


## Journal
Still contemplating on topics I really want to dig into. Really trying to spend more time reading a broad category of books instead of just technical topics. I spend enough time during my work hours learning about tech. Came across world-building and going to spend a few weeks reading up on how large fantasy novels are created. Just ordered The Sword of Kaigan. will arrive on Sat.

Trying my best to leave this journal as raw as possible. All the mistakes and typos I feel need to stay to encourage others that this does not need to be a published book. Just share your damn work and don't look back.

More formal writing will end up in another location. The goal there is truth and eye towards quality, but again does not have to perfect just well researched and provides value to someone.
